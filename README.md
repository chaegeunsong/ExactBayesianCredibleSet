# On Exact Bayesian Credible Sets for Classification and Pattern Recognition
This repository contains the R code from the paper 'On Exact Bayesian Credible Sets for Classification and Pattern Recognition'.

## Usage
+ [`source_function`](source_function): Source functions related to plots and sufficient dimension reduction from Li, B. (2018). _Sufficient dimension reduction: Methods and applications with R_. CRC Press. You do not need to run these functions. 

+ [`generalized_credible_set`](generalized_credible_set): Code to implement generalized credible sets. You need to run this first. The steering wheel plot is named a flower plot in the code. 

+ [`paper_figure`](paper_figure'): Code to run and duplicate figures, simulations, and data application in the paper. Some figures are generated as EPS files for publication. 

+ [`data`](data): Speaker accent data for data applications section.
